## Areas of Research
{:.icon-stats-bars}
#### Control systems
My recent work at the University of Leeds has focused on creating control laws for actuated bipedal walking robots, both classical and more adaptive schemes. During my Bachelor’s degree, my final project focused on designing and manufacturing a prototype factory floor robot, adhering to relevant BS:EN and ISO standards.

#### Dynamics simulation and modelling
I delved into learning about Denavit-Hartenberg parameterisation as part of a drone robotics module in my postgraduate study. I then went on to self-direct study in inverse dynamics, particularly the Recursive Newton Euler method, in order to better understand actuator control strategies for manipulator arms. As part of my dissertation project, I then trained myself to use the Bullet and ODE dynamics engines, in order to simulate dynamic systems and test control strategies on bipedal gaits.


#### Genetic algorithms and Neural Networks
My previous work in developing novel controllers for bipedal walkers led me to utilise genetic algorithms and other bio-inspired computing methodologies to find optimal,
realistic parameters for joint trajectories.


#### Software development
A large part of my studies, both academic and recreational, has centred around building my capabilities in programming and software, in order to quickly produce results for both design and analytical work.
