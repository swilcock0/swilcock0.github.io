We're running a Summer module as part of the [Leeds International Summer School](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-international-summer-school). The module will be delivered over a 2 week period, covering topics including
* History of shell structures
* Parametric design with Grasshopper
* Shell structure form finding techniques and algorithms
* Tesselation and planarisation for panelling
* Connection systems
* Design for digital fabrication

Additionally, students will be given the opportunity to manufacture designed components with laser cutting and 3D printing technologies, before culminating in the assembly of a shell structure based on initial design explorations. A field trip will also be included to look at relevant architecture in the real world.

## Who is this for?
Current university students or recent graduates, with some experience of CAD software. The design of the course is particularly suitable for those from architectural, engineering and design backgrounds.

See the [promotional flyer](https://samwilcock.xyz/Files/FlyerSummerSchool.pdf) and [https://www.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-international-summer-school](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-international-summer-school) for more info.

### Deadline for application 1st May 2022
