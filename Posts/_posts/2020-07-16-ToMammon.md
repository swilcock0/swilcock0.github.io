All hail the tomato overlord

So, with lockdown gradually being eased in the United Kingdom, my friend George and I made (yet another) song, this one for his brother's birthday. Our 3 months living together has been full of puppet shows, clown routines, and songs for friends... and rewatching this, I believe that they've been gradually getting weirder. 

So if you open the fridge one morning, and find a pentagram made of ketchup... beware... the sprouts are out to get you...

I don't even like ketchup.
