It would seem that the answer is yes. It's a bit buggy tho.
How much text do I have to write to fill the preview?
I'm not sure. Ah, it would appear that it's two lines. This is a PDF report from an embedded microprocessor program I wrote as part of a group. We first developed a basic graphics engine, and then built a version of Pong, for a Cyclone DE1-SoC Board.
