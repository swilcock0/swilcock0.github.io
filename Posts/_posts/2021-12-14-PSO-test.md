I kept seeing PSO being used in papers to minimise paths for manipulators, so I wrote a quick toy script to test it out. Here's the results with a Sphere function:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Sphere function PSO](/assets/img/Posts/2021-12-14-pso_Sphere_fn.gif){:height="500" width="500"}
{:refdef}
PSO with 5 particles acting on a sphere function landscape.

Here's the results with the [Easom function](http://www.geatbx.com/ver_3_3/fcneaso.html):
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Easom function PSO](/assets/img/Posts/2021-12-14-pso_Easom_fn.gif){:height="500" width="500"}
{:refdef}
PSO with 5 particles acting on an Easom function landscape.

And here's the results with a [Cross in tray function](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cross-in-tray_function.pdf):
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Easom function PSO](/assets/img/Posts/2021-12-14-pso_Cross_in_tray_fn.gif){:height="500" width="500"}
{:refdef}
PSO with 5 particles acting on an Easom function landscape.

The Python script used to generate these solutions can be found <a href="https://samwilcock.xyz/Files/PSO.py" target="_top_">here</a> - try it out [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SKBLOPDrIasRo3Bnb9pxI0MQT34XD2B-?usp=sharing).
